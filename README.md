# SensorFeatureTracking
Algorithms to track features of interest, such as KLT.

## Installing

This is an unregistered Julia package, but can be readily installed from a Julia console:
```julia
Pkg.clone("<URL TO YOUR GIT REPO FORK>")
```

The original upstream master is at: `https://github.com/dehann/SensorFeatureTracking.jl.git`


## Examples

Please see, as part of the development, two cases in the `examples` folder. These examples currently extract corner features from either an image file, or a webcam image sequence.

Please note this code is not yet optimized in any way. Performance can be improved.

## Unit TEst

Basic unit tests are currently under development in the `test` folder.
